Patch rebasing
==============

* Run from the desired target OS


* Download the kernel source by running:

  ./download_kernel


* Rebase patches against the downloaded kernel, these are placed inside an
  os_ver/ directory:

  ./rebase_patches [patch1 ... patchN]


For example:

  mv fedora_25{,.old}
  ./download_kernel && ./rebase_patches fedora_25.old/*.patch
